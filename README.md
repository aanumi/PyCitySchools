# WRITTEN ANALYSIS - PYCITYSCHOOLS

## OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS
The school board has identified key issues relating to academic dishonesty regarding the reading and math grades for Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis is to help the school board uphold state testing standards by replacing the inconsistent datasets for the 9th Grade Thomas High School with NaNs, keeping the unaffected data intact, and re-conducting the school district analysis with updated data.

## ANALYSIS RESULTS

•	How is the district summary affected?
When the 9th grade scores for math and reading for students at Thomas High School are removed, the total number of schools, students and budget stay the same. The percentages passing math, reading and passing overall are however reduced as a result of replacing a portion of the data with NaNs. The changes however are not too substantial as both the old and new analysis may likely round to the same whole numbers. An image of the updated adjusted analysis is seen below:
